            	Such a great experience as a trainee of FLGS studio, It is a challange being a Graphic Design student to follow an Interns focused on Web Programming. I got a lot of things by this opportunity being an exchange students who joined SEA-TVET program. i wasn't expect that i could follow the instructions. Sometimes it's difficult to understood, however Mr Boinx helped us when we get stucked at the momment. On the first day, Mam Arvee recognized us to Mr Boinx and other staff and i got surprised because the project manager was'nt here, but in Singapore. And we did a video call on laptop screen with him.

            	<p>It is s nice to be a part of FLGS, this studio has a fast Wi-fi connection and it's really improved our skill on programming. We use google hangout to chat each other among us, we always chat on the type bar while got any problem during training. Sometimes i got dizzy because the instructions, there's a lot terminologies i got. Even sometimes i need to open my dictionary to getting know what does it mean. Cause English is one of foreign language in Indonesia.</p>

            	<p> The link sent by Mr Boinx on Google Hangout was really useful. I just followed all the instruction and also watched youtube tutorial video which is bootstrap.

            	Freecodecamp gave me a lot of words about HTML and programming. It was interesting when i finished the task and continiued the other task.</p>
